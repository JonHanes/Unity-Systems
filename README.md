# Unity-Systems

This is a project I created purely to show some of what I did during my work with Williwaw, while not using the assets directly.
There is a credits file in the project with a list of dependencies, as I did not make the assets myself.

The scripts have been modified to work in a different type of game, and this is still a work in progress.
The main focal point of this project is to show the dialog editor, which was heavily inspired by the GameDev.tv video on RPG creation.

The systems in place now:
*Dialogue System
*Quest System
*Saving System
